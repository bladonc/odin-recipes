        <p>Who's to say you can't have a burger for breakfast?</p>
        <p>This recipe will show you how to make a tasty breakfast burger with nutritious and delicous mink meat</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground lean (7% fat) mink</li>
            <li>1 large egg </li>
            <li>½ cup minced onion </li>
            <li>¼ cup fine dried bread crumbs</li>
            <li> tablespoon Worcestershire </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, mix ground mink, egg, onion, bread crumbs, Worcestershire, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper until well blended. Divide mixture into four equal portions and shape each into a patty about 4 inches wide.</li>
            <li>Lay burgers on an oiled barbecue grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook burgers, turning once, until browned on both sides and no longer pink inside (cut to test), 7 to 8 minutes total. Remove from grill.</li>
            <li>Lay buns, cut side down, on grill and cook until lightly toasted, 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Spread mayonnaise and ketchup on bun bottoms. Add lettuce, tomato, burger, onion, and salt and pepper to taste. Set bun tops in place.</li>
        </ol>
